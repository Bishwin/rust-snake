# rust-snake
Retro snake game written in Rust.  
I'm hoping to return to this project as my skills develop and attempt:
* applying clean code principles
* writing unit tests
* new features (such as difficulty, color options, different gameboards)


rust-snake was created following the youtube playlist ["Intro to Rust"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT_7M7L7vo&list=PLJbE2Yu2zumDF6BX6_RdPisRVHgzV02NW&index=8)
